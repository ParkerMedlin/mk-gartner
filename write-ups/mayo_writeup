The seed for this project was a motherboard w/ Me-Yo logo on it. I was given basically free reign on this project, which is always fun because it usually means I get to branch out and try new stuff!

Originally my plan was to have the motherboard dissolve, as the title track for the album we were promoting is "Deleted". I grabbed a motherboard model from turboquid, rebuilt it from the components, and then set out to learn how to make this dissolve effect happen. I watched a few tutorials that used different networks of geometry nodes in Blender, but ultimately I abandoned this tack because my computer couldn't handle it. I think if I were faced with this task today I would've done just fine, but at the time I didn't realize the problem was poly count. The motherboard model could've used a TON of optimizing, and on top of that, I had it sitting inside a very hi-poly glass container in an environment that was entirely too hi-def... could go on and on, but I'll press on to the final iteration of this video.

I revised my concept to instead create a space station that seemed to be performing some sort of work on the motherboard object I'd created. At the drop of the song, you can see there is a sphere of what look like synapses firing around the motherboard. There is an abundance of glitchy HUD effects overlaid on the video as well. I felt that this visual aesthetic still interacted with the idea of being "deleted" in an interesting way--as if the motherboard was being scanned and analyzed so thoroughly that its very existence was being broken down into pure data, all while putting out so much power that it threatened the very system built to observe it. The glitchy overlays suggest a system pushed to its limits, perhaps even corrupting itself in its relentless pursuit to understand and deconstruct this artifact.
