The artwork and animation for this project were seeded with a vision for the client's musical project: "Sitting in silence, waiting for activation, perfecting the initial strike or the first move as if its the only one youll ever get." Our conversations immediately brought to mind some geometry node techniques I'd been learning about in blender. We had initially just discussed creating an animation synced to the track Sleeper Cell, but we decided that it would made the most sense for me to create the album art as well to keep a coherent visual voice for this whole project. 

I wanted the scene to open with an innocuous-looking rock inside a cell that would sprout crystals when "activated" as mentioned in the initial discussion, and I enjoyed the process of kitbashing a retrofuturistic science lab to contain the "Sleeper Cell". I learned a lot about optimizing renders since the last project, so things went a lot more smoothly all around. I began experimenting a little with DaVinci Resolve for post-processing on this project, but I leaned heavily on TouchDesigner for the displacement effects and glitch overlays that constituted the finishing touches for the project.

I really enjoyed the challenge of finding typography and composing an image of the art from the promo video to assemble the album artwork. I vastly prefer working on all the components of a project like this, as it allows me to ensure a cohesive visual language throughout. My biggest challenge was deciding that this project was done--I love the aesthetic and could've spent the next calendar year tweaking and adding things to make it cooler.
